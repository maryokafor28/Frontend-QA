How to ensure that my frontend implementation reflects the design provided by the UI/UX team,

I ensure that my frontend implementation accurately reflects the design provided by the UI/UX team. 
I begin by closely reviewing the design to match it precisely, including downloading any images used to 
avoid inconsistencies. I pay careful attention to details such as font type, font size, margins, paddings, 
and color schemes to ensure full alignment with the design specifications. Additionally, I review the prototype 
to understand and replicate the intended page navigation and user flow.
